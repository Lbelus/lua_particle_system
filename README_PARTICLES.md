1. Position
Coordinates: X, Y, Z coordinates defining the particle's position in 3D space.
2. Velocity
Speed: The magnitude of the particle's movement.
Direction: The direction in which the particle is moving (often as a vector).
3. Acceleration
Speed Change: Rate of change of velocity.
Directional Change: Direction in which the particle is accelerating.
4. Lifetime
Lifespan: The duration for which a particle exists.
Age: The current age of the particle (time since creation).
5. Size
Initial Size: The starting size of the particle.
Size Over Time: How the size changes over the particle’s lifetime (e.g., growth, shrinkage).
Size Variation: Randomness or variation in size.
6. Color
Initial Color: The starting color of the particle.
Color Over Time: How the color changes over the particle's lifetime (e.g., fading, transitioning).
Color Variation: Randomness or variation in color between particles.
7. Shape
Form: The shape of the particle (e.g., point, sphere, square).
Orientation: The rotation or alignment of the particle in space.
8. Texture
Texture Image: The texture applied to the particle (if any).
UV Coordinates: Texture mapping coordinates.
Animation: If the texture is animated, the sequence of frames.
9. Transparency/Opacity
Initial Opacity: The starting transparency level.
Opacity Over Time: How transparency changes over the particle’s lifetime.
10. Mass
Weight: The mass of the particle, affecting its interaction with forces like gravity.
11. Forces
Gravity: Influence of gravity on the particle.
Wind: Influence of wind on the particle.
Magnetic Fields: Influence of magnetic fields, if applicable.
12. Rotation
Spin: Rate of rotation about an axis.
Rotation Over Time: How rotation changes over the particle's lifetime.
13. Emission Rate
Birth Rate: How many particles are created per unit of time.
Emission Shape: The spatial distribution of newly emitted particles (e.g., point, sphere, cone).
14. Collision
Collision Detection: Whether the particle collides with other objects.
Bounce: Behavior after collision (e.g., elasticity).
Friction: How much the particle slows down after collision.
15. Trail/Afterimage
Trail Length: Length of the particle's trail.
Trail Fade: How quickly the trail fades out.
Trail Color: Color of the trail, potentially changing over time.
16. Interactivity
Behavior: How particles interact with each other (e.g., repulsion, attraction).
Response to Input: How particles react to user input or environmental changes.
17. Lighting
Glow: Whether the particle emits light.
Reflection: How the particle reflects light.
Shadow: Whether the particle casts or receives shadows.
18. Noise
Perlin Noise: Application of noise to the particle's position, velocity, or size.
Turbulence: Small chaotic variations in movement or appearance.
19. Behavior Scripts
Custom Scripts: User-defined behaviors that dictate how particles act based on conditions or time.
20. Emission Source Characteristics
Origin: The point or area from which particles are emitted.
Emission Angle: The angle or spread of particle emission.
